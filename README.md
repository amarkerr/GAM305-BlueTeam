#### Brainstorming
Brainstorming and meeting notes can be found on [our wiki](https://github.com/amarkerr/GAM305-BlueTeam/wiki)!

Our team met twice over week 2 and discussed the following developmental topics:
* Story and charcter
* Enviroment
* Level
* Mechanics(controls, level design, character design, pick-ups, enemy design and AI, projectiles, character interactions)

Additionally, the team discussed roles suited to skillsets and interestests and began creation of their project and tracker while keeping in frequent communication over the their Discord server.

#### Story
Our story follows Pila, a goblin-like creature living in a dystopian world overrun by robots. With almost all humans wiped out and very few natural creatures left, Pila is determined to take her world back by collecting world seeds and fighting back.
