* Shooter/Platformer style game
* 4 additional elements
   1. Stationary enemies (enemty turrets with player tracking, turrets will have different dps and health)
   2. Moving obstacles (moving platforms, pendulum, falling rocks)
   3. Trap obstacles (trap floor, spike maze)
   4. Boss enemy
  
The team will also attempt to complete general object pickup if the project timeline allows

<br/>

#### Brainstorming
Brainstorming and meeting notes can be found on [our wiki](https://github.com/amarkerr/GAM305-BlueTeam/wiki)!

Our team met twice over week 2 and discussed the following developmental topics:
* Story and charcter
* Enviroment
* Level
* Mechanics(controls, level design, character design, pick-ups, enemy design and AI, projectiles, character interactions)

Additionally, the team discussed roles suited to skillsets and interestests and began creation of their project and tracker while keeping in frequent communication over the their Discord server. 

<br/>

#### Story
Our story follows Pila, a goblin-like creature living in a dystopian world overrun by robots. With almost all humans wiped out and very few natural creatures left, Pila is determined to take her world back by collecting world seeds and fighting back.

## Module Three: QA and Testing Plan
<br/>

#### Test Process and Documentation Plan
* The team determined it would be best to use a hands-on processs to test and evaluate. This will mimic playtesting through all the testing processes. All objects needing to be tested will be on our Test Tracker. All bugs found will be reported and monitored via our Bug Tracker.
  * Our test plan and checklist: [Test Tracker](https://github.com/users/amarkerr/projects/3) 
  * Our bug report tracker: [Bug Report tracker](https://github.com/users/amarkerr/projects/4)

 
<br/>

#### Test Schedule
* Our tentative schedule for main test phases is as follows (this aligns with the Friday before the Sunday phase release):
  * Play Test: 01/31/2025
  * Demo Test: 02/07/2025
  * Code release: 02/14/2025

## Module Four: Team Reflection
<br/>

* What parts of the testing process did the team perceive to go well?
* How were bugs identified and corrected?
* In terms of the QA and testing process, what would you do differently to improve the process?
* What tools (chosen in Module Two) did you find successful in the development of your Alpha project? Why?
* Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
* How did the team approach to the initial analysis of the game design document contribute to the decision to use these tools and techniques?
